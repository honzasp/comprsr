This article is about the planet. For other uses, see Earth (disambiguation).

Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the
eight planets in the Solar System. It is also the largest of the Solar System's
four terrestrial planets. It is sometimes referred to as the world or the Blue
Planet.[22]

Earth formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago, and life appeared on its
surface within its first billion years.[23] Earth's biosphere then significantly
altered the atmospheric and other basic physical conditions, which enabled the
proliferation of organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer, which
together with Earth's magnetic field blocked harmful solar radiation, and
permitted formerly ocean-confined life to move safely to land.[24] The physical
properties of the Earth, as well as its geological history and orbit, have
allowed life to persist. Estimates on how much longer the planet will be able to
continue to support life range from 500 million years (myr), to as long as 2.3
billion years (byr).[25][26][27]

Earth's lithosphere is divided into several rigid segments, or tectonic plates,
that migrate across the surface over periods of many millions of years. About
71% of the surface is covered by salt water oceans, with the remainder
consisting of continents and islands which together have many lakes and other
sources of water that contribute to the hydrosphere. Earth's poles are mostly
covered with ice that is the solid ice of the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea
ice that is the polar ice packs. The planet's interior remains active, with a
solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates the magnetic field,
and a thick layer of relatively solid mantle.

Earth gravitationally interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun
and the Moon. During one orbit around the Sun, the Earth rotates about its own
axis 366.26 times, creating 365.26 solar days, or one sidereal year.[note 7] The
Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4Â° away from the perpendicular of its
orbital plane, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface with a
period of one tropical year (365.24 solar days).[28] The Moon is Earth's only
natural satellite. It began orbiting the Earth about 4.53 billion years ago
(bya). The Moon's gravitational interaction with Earth stimulates ocean tides,
stabilizes the axial tilt, and gradually slows the planet's rotation.

The planet is home to millions of species of life, including humans.[29] Both
the mineral resources of the planet and the products of the biosphere contribute
resources that are used to support a global human population.[30] These
inhabitants are grouped into about 200 independent sovereign states, which
interact through diplomacy, travel, trade, and military action. Human cultures
have developed many views of the planet, including its personification as a
planetary deity, its shape as flat, its position as the center of the universe,
and in the modern Gaia Principle, as a single, self-regulating organism in its
own right.
